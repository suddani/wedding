            The biggest gift for us is you attending.
            But if you really want to bring something, we would appreciate a contribution to our honeymoon trip which we plan to do right after the wedding.

          <h3>How to get to Zalishchyky from Germany</h3>
          <p>
            There are three airports with a good connection to the town.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Kyiv
                <p>
                  There is a direct sleep train to the town, but it takes 12 hours (2:30pm - 2:40am).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Lviv
                <p>
                  There is a direct bus connection to the town.
                  However, the bus takes 6 hours and the last one leaves before 3pm.
                  <br></br>Otherwise the trip has to be done via Ternopil or Chernivtsi (there is a train connection from Lviv) and then by bus.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Chernivtsi
                <p>
                  It is only 40km away from the venue. There are a lot of bus connections as well as a train that goes once a day.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            Train tickets are <a href="https://booking.uz.gov.ua/en/">available</a> 45 days before the departure date and we strongly recommend to book them as soon as they are available.
            At the same time, bus tickets can be easily <a href="http://ticket.bus.com.ua/order/forming_bn?point_from=UA4610100000&point_to=UA6122010100&date=01.03.20&date_add=1&fn=round_search" target="_blank">bought</a> a few days before the departure date.
            As an alternative to both, you can use BlaBlaCar since it is very popular in Ukraine.
            For short trips (for example, from the airport to the train station) you can also use Uber.
            <br></br>
            If you plan to use public transportation please let us know when and where (Ternopil or Chernivtsi) you plan to be.
            We will help you to book a group ticket with other guests together.
